# Clarity browser extension

Have you ever navigated to a website with the intention of doing one thing, and then found yourself distracted and clicking on something else?

Human beings are prone to distractions and in an age where websites makes their money by driving user engagement, it is no wonder
we find ourselves being diverted by other content that wastes our time and energy.

This browser extension combats this by removing those distracting sections of websites giving the user a simpler experience.

### Why not an Ad-blocker?

An Ad-blocker like uBlock Origin is great for stopping distracting advertisements and trackers, but it is not designed to combat the
user engagement tricks websites employ.

### Why not Reader mode?

Reader mode is great for text based content, however when using it for popular media websites it does not provide a seamless user experience.

### Why not a Styliser addon with custom CSS?

Custom styliser addons work really well to change the appearance of a particular website, but they are not easy to use and are overkill
for just hiding some distracting parts of a webpage.
